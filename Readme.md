# MANDALA - Stepping Into The Circular Economy

## About

My sincerest wish is for these machines to present real solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing us today as a multi-species society inhabiting a single planet.
If they ultimately fail at delivering that, may they at least then serve to ignite some spark of inspiration in countless others for them to then look for and recognise practical solutions that can be used towards building a livable planet that we can all share together.
If we, each of us share good solutions freely with each other, so that in the end we in turn each profit thereby a thousand-fold and obtain great bountifulness, MIGHT we not then all be more likely to make it through this in one piece?
Sounding **CODE INFRARED**!
