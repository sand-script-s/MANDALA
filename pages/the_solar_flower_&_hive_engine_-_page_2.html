                        I've been referring to spherical heating elements throughout the article so far, but actually that may not be the best shape for such an application. After all, one would want to physically press up a heating element snugg against a receiving element in order to transfer the heat through conduction effectively. But spheres are inherently difficult to press up against anything, which is why they tend to roll so well. So really we want flat surfaces on our heating materials for this reason. A cube may thus work as a better suited shape for the heating element.<br>
                        <br>

                        <img class="modestwidth-twothirds" src="https://media.tenor.com/ttDnsvcHbpQAAAAC/rainbow-rainbow-cube.gif" alt="image"><br>
                        <br>

                        Well actually we can break the cube up into many flat layers, which are held together as a cube during transport and heating, but which can also be seperated from each other, and is each one a heating element in it's own right.<br>
                        <br>

                        <a href="https://www.recipesteen.com/seven-layer-gelatin-salad-recipe/" target="_blank"><img class="modestwidth-twothirds" src="https://www.recipesteen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Seven-Layer-Gelatin-Salad-4.jpg" alt="image"></a><br>
                        <br>

                        Since I have nowhere else to put this, and it's not really applicable to what I'm talking about anyway, I'll just plop this animation of a fractal cube down here to serve as abstract inspiration. It would make for a good air heating block if 3D printed in ceramic.<br>
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        So now we have a stack of flat blocks forming a cube, how will they be held together? Let's forget, for now, about any ideas of a shell holding them together and look for something more basic.<br>
                        Perhapse these blocks could be held together, and generally maneuvered, by each having two little knobs sticking out of it on opposing sides.<br>
                        <br>

                        <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/eneryda-knob-chrome-plated-50347503/" target="_blank"><img class="modestwidth-halfer" src="https://www.ikea.com/eg/en/images/products/eneryda-knob-chrome-plated__0754156_pe747798_s5.jpg" alt="image"></a> &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        

                        <a href="https://optimumbrasses.co.uk/shop/knobs/plain-knobs/plain-knob-a49/" target="_blank"><img class="modestwidth-halfer" src="https://optimumbrasses.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/A49-Samsung-retry-1-scaled-1024x1024.jpg" alt="image"></a><br>
                        <br>
                       
                        The knobs can either be inserted metal pieces, as above, or baked in ceramic along with the rest of it, or cast in concrete, around a wire framework or rod providing support.<br>
                        <br>

                        We now have a cube made up of a number of layered blocks with a row of knobs running down two of its opposing sides. So if, for example, the cube was composed of four layered blocks, it would have four knobs sticking out and running down the left side and four down the right side. These can then be grabbed and held in place by a modified scissor-tong mechanism.<br>
                        <br>

                        <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Yammee-Foundry-Tongs-Stainless-Steel-Professional-Grade-Crucible-Crucible-Tong-Lab-Tool/18377322614" target="_blank"><img class="modestwidth-twothirds" src="https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/Yammee-Foundry-Tongs-Stainless-Steel-Professional-Grade-Crucible-Crucible-Tong-Lab-Tool_6364edd1-41b8-4819-9d67-b24951d50795.acefc79f4e0bb5c29024770cfa2a3634.jpeg?odnHeight=2000&odnWidth=2000&odnBg=FFFFFF" alt="image"></a><br>
                        <br>

                        The front of the tongs, where they combine, can be made to be two elongated pieces of flat metal, that when pressed together have shared holes cut out to grab around the knobs. Or similarly two pieces of waveform wire coming over and across each other may even work if stiff enough.<br>
                        The tongs, after having closed around the knobs, can then be secured in place by a metal pin or other similar mechanism.<br>
                        <br>

                        <a href="https://www.fastmovertoolsuk.com/fast-mover-tools-dent-puller-wavy-wire-100pcs.html" target="_blank"><img class="modestwidth-halfer" src="https://www.fastmovertoolsuk.com/media/catalog/product/cache/f388f619f60737290ff00841d2d0fd31/f/m/fmt5416.jpg" alt="image"></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;

                        <br>

                        Furthermore the prongs then extend out into an extruding rod, such that when both tongs are held onto the cube, on both sides, it ultimately holds all the blocks together while also forming a rotisserie for the whole contraption to rotate on the solar spot with as well as to roll down the track with. This image is unfortunately the closest example that I could find to illustrate what I'm talking about. The chicken would be the cube and the prongs would be tongs.<br>
                        <br>

                        <img class="modestwidth-threequarters" src="https://i.etsystatic.com/15545177/r/il/b224d2/6340286315/il_1080xN.6340286315_biod.jpg" alt="image"><br>
                        <br>

                        A little gear can be attached to the very ends of the rods to provide the mechanism for rotating the cube in the solar spot. And when it has then reached the desired temperature the whole kebab-like contraption is released to roll on its rods along a wire track, towards a receiving unit that subsequently unlocks and disengages the tongs, so that the loose standing pile of blocks can be swept away one by one to their respective destinations, where they will then be pressed, against a metal or ceramic plate in order to heat it.<br>
                        <br>

                        There may be some problems with using the form of a cube though, in that it's sharp edges and corners may reflect a greater portion of light when cooking on the solar spot. As I have mentioned the light reflecting off of these objects could seriously be blinding, and it would also heat up those areas disproportionately as well, which may cause cracking through continued cycles. So for that reason it might be better to use of cylinders instead of blocks.<br>
                        <br>

                        <a href="https://www.dearyesteryear.com/products/stone-coaster-set" target="_blank"><img class="modestwidth-twothirds" src="https://www.dearyesteryear.com/cdn/shop/files/42500174_e3961cd4-111d-407e-9e61-cf8196c1c383_800x.jpg?v=1706744468" alt="image"></a><br>
                        <br>

                        By the same logic a sphere could also still be used with it divided up into layered pieces, but then of course you would have to work with differently sized heating blocks.<br>
                        Whatever form is used for the heating materials, thorough deliberation still needs to be given on how to minimise the light spill-off from the solar concentrator, as to prevent eye injuries or other accidents.<br>
                        <br>

                        Regarding the heating blocks, I can envision a developed form of the technology where, for example, a cylindrical heating element is made up of three or four layered pieces, but those pieces themselves are containers housing a dozen or so thin super-hot metal plates that are spit out in rapid succession during operation and pressed quickly onto receiving heat plates in an automated fashion.<br>
                        <br>

                        So heat directly for heating jobs. Very good. But how about electricity generation?<br>
                        <br>
                        Well, actually that may not be off the table.<br>
                        <br>

                        <span class="ytvids"><span class="vidprev">

                        <br>

                        So my general idea here is to use the aforedescribed solar concentrator & heating material with track setup; to simply heat up water. But not for a shower. The hot water is for powering a <a class="clink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine">Stirling engine</a>.<br>
                        <br>

                        Here is a clearer explanation of its mechanical workings:<br>
                        <span class="ytvids"><span class="vidprev">
                            <lite-youtube videoid="wGRmcvxB_dk" playlabel="How A Stirling Engine Works"></lite-youtube>   
                        </span></span><br>
                        <br>

                        The Stirling engine is a heat engine working on the principle of the expansion and contraction of gas, usually air, at different temperatures. There are different <a class="clink" href="https://www.thermal-engineering.org/7-types-of-stirling-engines-for-external-combustion-applications/">versions</a> (or arrangements) for Stirling engines. Notably the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Free-Piston Arrangements. The above two videos showcased a version of the Gamma arrangement.<br>
                        <br>

                        Their most popular use today, however, comes in the form of little desktop toys in several variants, mostly meant for showcasing the principle and not much else. As mentioned in one of those videos, Stirling didn't exactly win out against the Steam turbine and the development of the technology seems to have pretty much come to a halt in the late 1800's. That is except for some modern day tinkerers giving it another shot on YouTube, some of those I'll post links to later.<br>

                        <br>

                        The problem with these toy models is that they have a terrible cost to power ratio. They are really designed just to showcase the principle and so they have very small heating chambers and short strokes, as this allows them to create a lot of movement (speed) with very little power. For demonstration purposes this is ideal, but in terms of wattage they often fall far short of producing even a single watt of electricity when connected to a small DC generator.<br>
                        <br>

                        0.25 Watts measured from this Stirling engine toy:<br>
                        <span class="ytvids"><span class="vidprev">

                        </span></span><br>
                        <br>

                        I seem to recall having watched a video where someone measured the power output of one of those flat coffee cup Gamma types, and it did indeed measure to be around one watt, as the guy in the first video on this topic was guessing above. But I couldn't find that video when I was searching for it again so I may have made it up.<br>
                        The power delivered is of course dependent on the temperature difference between the two plates, for one thing.<br>
                        <br>

                        It is safe to say that these models are not actually worth their weight in steel when it comes to real power generation. They do work great as ornaments though.<br>
                        <br>

                        There are bigger Stirling engines in existence, that produce real power. But these tend to be bulky, heavy and heated by wood or gas fires. And they probably underperform compared to a similar size and weight steam engine. Although they tend to be a lot quieter which is why they are sometimes preferred.<br>
                        <br>

                        The great thing about the little toy engines are that because they are so lightweight and don't have to be driven by combustion or even by an open flame, they can thus be built from pretty much anything. And people have utilised everything from wood to soda cans to CDs in building little miniature versions of the Stirling engine.<br>

                        However these homemade contraptions often suffer from a variety of bad engineering choices and immensely sloppy tolerances. Again, they are mostly made for showcasing the principle. Rarely does it seem anyone is really trying to squeeze power out of these soda bottle versions.<br>
                        <br>

                        My tendency to think in terms of modular scaling led me to ponder the following; if one of those small coffee cup engines can produce one watt of power, is there any way in which to just stuff, say 1000 of them <nobr>(10 x 10 x 10)</nobr> into a box and somehow have that produce a combined kilowatt of electrical power via a generator?<br>
                        <br>

                        The advantage of such an approach over simply super-sizing a single piston is that one could still potentially get a good ammount of energy from a relatively small temperature difference, hot water, say, as opposed to an incinerator.<br>
                        This would be much safer in the long term as well as easier to maintain.<br>
                        <br>

                        It also enables using much more affordable materials and methods of construction. For prototyping purposes one could even test different engine layouts using scrap like plastic bottles and cans, etc. glued together to make the piston units. This simplifies early prototyping as it requires no precision welding or similarly difficult and laborious procedures.<br>
                        The difficulty now gets passed on to the sheer ammount of units that need to be constructed.<br>
                        Plastic shouldn't ultimately be used in production though, as the continual heating and cooling of the air would constantly shed microplastics into the atmosphere during operation.<br>
                        <br>

                        The bottleneck, no pun inteded, then becomes the construction of hundreds of these engine units. If one unit for example takes a person three hours to produce, then extending that linearly would mean that it could take the same person the better part of a year to produce a thousand or so units.<br>
                        Thus continual assessment should be made as to opportunities for cost-effective local automation.<br>
                        If manufacturing a thousand piston units for a single engine proves too much however, then perhaps two hundred units could suffice, or one hundred even? It might be enough.<br>
                        <br>

                        But if one wanted to string together hundreds of pistons, how would you even go about doing so? What known engine layout would be appropriate, if any?<br>

                        So it is the case that with internal combustion engines a lot of care is given to ensure that all the moving parts in the engine are as balanced as they could possibly be in order to decrease vibrations that would cause wear or even damage. It is worth keeping in mind though that automotive engines produce hundreds and sometimes thousands of horsepower which is thrust around through the heavy-duty steel crankshaft and connected steel parts.<br>
                        Our device however, with which we are <i>aiming</i> to produce one kilowatt of power, which equates to around one and a half horsepower, we could probably get away with less than absolute perfect balance provided that a strong and stiff frame is put in place to soak up any residual vibrations.<br>
                        <br>

                        Regarding the engine layout, judging only from my quick glance over the subject, it seems that a <i>radial engine</i> configuration may be the best suited for just weaving in dozens of pistons cohesively, as it can be extended by simply adding more radial engines in a row.<br>

                        For context, this is a rotary engine as opposed to a radial engine. To think that people were willing to take to the air in these things:<br>

                        In an effort to reduce the enormous number of individual parts needed for a hundred cylinder engine, it may prove benificiary to have an entire row of let's say 15 Stirling pistons, shoot upwards at the same time while pressing against a mutual rod, in much the same manner as a row of people would lift up a giant log which would normally be too heavy for one of them move.<br>
                        <br>

                        <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/754409" target="_blank"><img class="modestwidth-full" src="../assets/images/article_solar_flower/military_log_soldier_army_training.jpg" alt="image"></a><br>
                        <br>
                    
                        Rows of these conjoined pistons can then be positioned around a central crankshaft in a radial engine layout. The row-long combined pistons mean that there doesn't have to be a connecting rod to the crankshaft for every piston head. Rather a connecting rod can be provided every so many pistons, say for every five pistons. So a row of fifteen pistons may only need four connecting rods, and in turn a 75 piston radial arrangement (five rows of fifteen pistons each) may only require four attachment rings and four counterweights, etc.<br>
